							<p>
								The Joker is a supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, 
								and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman, published by DC Comics. 
								As a fictional character and the archenemy of Batman, the Joker has been represented in a variety of different 
								stories that redefine elements of the characters appearance and personality.

							<p>The Joker debuted in Batman #1 (spring 1940) as the eponymous character's first villain, about a year after Batman's debut in Detective Comics #27 
								(May 1939). The Joker initially appeared as a remorseless serial killer, modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin, 
								who killed his victims with "Joker Venom," a toxin that left their faces smiling grotesquely.[18] The character was intended to be killed 
								in his second appearance in Batman #1, after being stabbed in the heart.</p>

							<p>The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear 
								regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, 
								as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance 
								comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, 
								which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his 
								disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.</p>

									The 1992 animated series introduced the Joker's female sidekick: Harley Quinn, 
									a psychiatrist who falls for—and ends up in an abusive relationship with—the Joker, 
									becoming his supervillain accomplice. The character was popular, and was adapted into 
									the comics as the Joker's romantic interest in 1999.[59] In the same year, Alan Grant 
									and Norm Breyfogle's comic book Anarky concluded with the revelation that the titular 
									character was the Joker's son.
